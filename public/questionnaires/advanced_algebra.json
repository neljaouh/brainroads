      "question": "What is the solution to x² - 5x + 6 = 0?",
      "options": ["x = 2, x = 3", "x = 1, x = 6", "x = -2, x = -3", "x = 0, x = 5"],
      "correct": "x = 2, x = 3",
      "explanation": "Factoring gives (x-2)(x-3) = 0, so x = 2 or x = 3."

      "type": "truefalse",
      "question": "The quadratic formula can solve any quadratic equation.",
      "correct": true,
      "explanation": "The quadratic formula x = (-b ± √(b²-4ac)) / 2a works for all quadratic equations."

      "question": "What is the degree of the polynomial 3x⁴ + 2x² - 5?",
      "correct": "4",
      "explanation": "The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable, which is 4 in this case."
